53c700.c \
 * [status] spatch-ok
 * old: we didn't modify correctly the prototype, we should not put a name
   for the parameter
 * [bug] maintainer forgot to remove the decl of hostptr, shadowing
     the one now given in parameter.
 * initialize proc_info not via initializer but via 
   tpnt->proc_info = etc.

   old code was left unchanged
