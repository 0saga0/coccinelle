 spelling mistake in pci_set_dma_mask added by the programmer.
 a call to pci_set_consistent_dma_mask(pci, 0x3fffffff) without a test in the
 source code is converted into a test in this case.  In another case like this
 it was just dropped, so we have taken that as the general solution, although
 that might be incorrect...
