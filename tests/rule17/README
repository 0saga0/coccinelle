amd7930.c: 
  * contains related but independent CE: moving declaration of (struct)
    variable from argument list to local variable replacing argument
    with (void *)
  * independent CE: names of field members in sub-structures, e.g.:
      - schedule_work(&bcs->hw.amd7930.tq_xmt);
      + schedule_work(&bcs->hw.amd7930.xmt_work);
