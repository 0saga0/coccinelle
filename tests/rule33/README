Rule 33
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Spatch revision: N/A
Cocci file     : rule33.cocci
Cocci file rev.: N/A
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that the rule only works with: 

  E && major(CURRENT->rq_dev) == MAJOR_NR

not 

  major(CURRENT->rq_dev) == MAJOR_NR && E

also had to use current_valid(...) instead of current_valid(void)
because of spatch parser problems.
