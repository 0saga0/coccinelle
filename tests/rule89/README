Cocci file: rule89.cocci
No bugs
Two files suffer from cocci errors and one gives the wrong answer because
the rule is not complete enough.


bond_main.c
 * [status] ok

led.c
 * [status] wrong
 there is nothing in the rule to take care of inserting the require include
 declaration.
 this example requires the -ifdef option

qeth_main.c
 * [status] ok

sdlamain.c
 * [status] error
 adds local and unlock at the beginning and end of the function, ie before
 the initial declarations and after the return
 there may also be a performance problem, with too many permutations of
 witnesses in an AU that I don't understand

strip.c
 * [status] ok

syncppp.c
 * [status] error
 flow_to_ast doesn't like a switch where "default" appears first


Key: ok means a .ok file is generated
     spatch-ok means that the result is different in inessential ways
     wrong means that the result is wrong
     error means that coccinelle crashes
     bugs refers to cases where the hand transformation is wrong.
