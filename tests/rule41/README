mdc800.c
 * [status] fail
 * [bug] according to rules.tex. forget to remove the && retval = -ENOENT ...
 * Second bug is that now that usb_register_dev make reference to fops_val, he
   has to know this variable which is declared at the bottom of this,
   and so he should move the definition of the variable at the top of the file,
   but instead he declare another variable with the same name. forward
   declaration works only for function, not for variable.
