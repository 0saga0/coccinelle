  problem in determining the type of the bcs expression, but perhaps not
  important, so metavariable changed to expression

isar.c
  * [status] wrong
  * [rule] SP doesn't drop some #defines that were in this code, and I
    guess should be defined in the library
  * warning: complex initializer, cocci does not handle that

jade_irq.c:
  * [status] wrong
  * [rule] Doesn't work because the function definition is in the file
    jade.c. The person who did the patch by hand updated the calls in
    this file correctly, but the patch does not include anything for
    jade.c
