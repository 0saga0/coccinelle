You must first install a recent version of 
 - OCaml (at least 3.09.2), 
   see http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html
 - the Menhir parser generator (at least 20080912),
   see http://cristal.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/
   (unless you got a version of the coccinelle source with
   the SmPL parser pre-generated)
 - Python and its development files (python-dev)
   (unless you run configure with the --without-python option)
 - pdftk and graphviz (with PDF support) if you want to use
   the -graphical_trace option   

Then simply type 
 ./configure
 make depend
 make
 make install

Note:	'make' will compile the bytecode version by default.
	You could use 'make all.opt' to have the optimized version.
	If you compile both, 'make install' will take care of that
	and install both, spatch and spatch.opt.
	If you use only one of them, 'make install' will install
	the one you have compiled, either spatch ou spatch.opt,
	under the front-end spatch. You could use 'make world' to
	compile the bytecode and the native code version.

	We provide the files generated by menhir in the tarball.
	However, 'make distclean' will remove them. You could
	either restore them from the tarball or install menhir.
	Using 'make clean' should be safe with regards to these files.
