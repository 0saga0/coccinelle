This directory contains code to distribute cpatch among multiple
processors.  To adjust the actual call to spatch, modify the file
spatch_linux_script, but leave it in the current directory.

Normally, after running make and make install, spatch_linux foo.cocci will
make 9 processes applying foo.cocci to the files in the directory mentioned
in spatch_linux_script.  The result will be in foo.  spatch_linux foo.cocci
n will do the same, but for n processes rather than 9.
