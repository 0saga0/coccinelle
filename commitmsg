Release coccinelle-0.1.7

** Language:
   - initialize and finalize script code, cf demos/initial_final.cocci

** Features:
   - -iso_limit option to limit the depth of isomorphism application
   - with the dir option, the include path is implicitly set to the "include"
     subdirectory of the specified directory, if the option -I is not used.
   - give a seed for the name of a fresh identifier
   - better handling of cpp "constructed" identifiers as in a##b, that in
     the futur will make it easier to match over those idents.
     cf tests/pb_parsing_macro.c. Thanks to Ali-Erdem Ozcan for pointing
     out the problem. A new "parsing hack hint" is also available:
     YACFE_IDENT_BUILDER, cf standard.h.

** Bugfix:
   - drop excessive "optimization" in ctl generation for while and for loops
   - allow . as the name of the directory
   - for type inference for an assignment, take the type of the right-hand
     side expression, not the type of the assigned variable
   - allow for with a declartion in the first header element, as in C++
     (partial support)
   - allow for matching against variable declarations that include only
     storage, eg static, but no type at all.
   - allow for matching against types that contain both short/long and int
   - allow the type metavariable in the SmPL code "unsigned T" to match a T
     that is a type consisting of more than one word, eg long int.
   - -ifdef_to_if option made to process nested ifdefs
     (partial support)

** Internals:
   - improve and fix installation process (usable on BSD)
   - improve and fix testing process
   - apply patches from Eugeniy Meshcheryakov
   - reorganize the way we parse C identifiers, especially concatenated cpp
     identifiers as in a##b. This may lead to some regressions as we may
     not parse as much code as before.
   - removed popl/ and popl09/ and popl related stuff from official distrib.
