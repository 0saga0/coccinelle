Release coccinelle-0.1.10

** Language:
   - declarations allowed in switch, suggested by Derek M. Jones

** Features:
   - use interval timer for timeouts.  Thanks to Derek M. Jones for the
     implementation.
   - more flexible env.sh, thanks to Derek Jones.
   - faster Python invocation
   - simplify unparsing in the sgrep case

** Bugfix:
   - for glimpse there is no point to create a pattern containing a numeric
     constant because glimpse doesn't index them
   - add spaces after commas in function calls and function headers
   - made python integration more like the ubuntu version
     http://patches.ubuntu.com/by-release/extracted/debian/c/coccinelle/0.1.5dbs-2/01-system-pycaml
     this fixes some memory management problems with None, True, and False
   - correct labels associated with a switch in the CFG so that a statement
     metavariable can match a switch.  Thanks to Derek Jones for pointing out
     the problem.
   - keep switch pattern within switch body.  Thanks to Derek Jones for
     pointing out the problem.
   - Allow expanded tokens to be stored in metavariables, as long as they are
     not removed.  But this does currently allow them in + code, which will
     produce the expansion.  Thanks to Ali-Erdem Ozcan for pointing out the
     problem.
   - improved adjustment of spacing when code removed at the beginning of a line
