Release coccinelle-0.1.4

** Language:
   - long long added to SmPL

** Documentation:
   - add grammar reference and spatch command line options reference

** Features:
   - can match patterns of the form unsigned T or signed T, where T is a
     metavariable
   - dropped the sizeof_parens isomorphism, which was made redundant by the
     paren isomorphism
   - simple rule generation

** Bugfix:
   - trailing , ; and ) no longer left on a line by themselves
   - better treatment of error exit when the searched for code matches the
     error exit condition.
   - fix incorrect treatment of parentheses in test_exps that could allow +
     code to be added twice
   - don't ask whether iterator names and declarer names should be declared as
     metavariables.
   - slightly better support for expression list metavariables.
   - short and long allowed for array index types in SmPL
   - more restrictions on type inference for pointer arithmetic in SmPL
   - allow isomorphisms to apply when + code is anywhere within all - terms
   - changed order of printing const and volatile
   - allow  eg ... <... in plus code
   - better formatting of generated if/while/etc. code
   - better parse error reporting when the problem is at the end of the file

** Internals:
   - isomorphisms don't apply under signed/unsigned, to prevent the creation
     of things like unsigned signed int.  Need a better solution for this.
