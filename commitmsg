Release coccinelle-0.1.6

** Language:
   - the ability to add comments

** Features:
   - grouping of generated rules with -hrule option
   - handling of special coccinelle comments
     /* {{coccinelle:skip_start}} */ and
     /* {{coccinelle:skip_end}} */
     allowing to give more hints to the C parser.
     Thanks to Flavien@lebarbe.net for the idea.
   - the ability to print the values of more (but not all) kinds of
     metavariables from python
   - new vim SmPL mode.
     Thanks to Alexander Faroy.

** Bugfix:
   - consider the ident tokens also in the 2 lines before the error line for the
     10-most-problematic-parsing-errors diagnostic.
   - SmPL parser allows cast as the argument of a pointer
   - SmPL type checker allows enum as an array index
   - Better generation of fresh metavariables names in hrule
   - no more warnings about things that should be metavariables when there is
     a disjunction in a function position
   - bugfix in parser, better error message.
     Thanks to Ali-Erdem OZCAN <ali-erdem.ozcan@st.com> for the bug report.
