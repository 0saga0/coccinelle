Release coccinelle-0.1.11

** Language:
   - Meta-identifier/function and constant could be filtered from SmPL by
     regular expressions using the "~=" and "!~=" operators followed by
     an OCaml regular expression (see man Str) in double quote.
   - Virtual rules, which can be referenced in depends, and set and unset
     using the command-line options -D
   - ++ for multiple additions

** Features:
   - coccicheck: a framework to check a series of SmPL files on a project
     see scripts/coccicheck for more information

** Bugfix:
   - bind position variables to the correct starting position in the case of a
     complex statement such as an if or while.  Thanks to Derek Jones for
     pointing out the problem.
   - checking for non mentioned case lines in switch should be unchecked.
   - space should be printed after sizeof when there are no parentheses around
     the argument.  Thanks to Daniel Walker for pointing out the problem.
   - avoid introducing sharing in propagating ! over () in treatment of isos
   - save_excursion has to handle and rethrow exceptions
   - eliminate unnecessary consideration of CVS strings.  Thanks to David
     Young for pointing out the problem.
   - completely new treatment of statement metavariables
   - better type checking for macro definitions
   - drop regression testing in -parse_c
