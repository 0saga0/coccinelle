* 0.1.4

** Features: 
- can match patterns of the form unsigned T or signed T, where T is a
  metavariable
- dropped the sizeof_parens isomorphism, which was made redundant by the
  paren isomorphism
- simple rule generation
- long long added to SmPL

** Bugfix:
- trailing , ; and ) no longer left on a line by themselves
- better treatment of error exit when the searched for code matches the
  error exit condition.
- fix incorrect treatment of parentheses in test_exps that could allow +
  code to be added twice
- don't ask whether iterator names and declarer names should be declared as
  metavariables.
- slightly better support for expression list metavariables.
- short and long allowed for array index types in SmPL
- more restrictions on type inference for pointer arithmetic in SmPL
- allow isomorphisms to apply when + code is anywhere within all - terms
- changed order of printing const and volatile
- allow  eg ... <... in plus code
- better formatting of generated if/while/etc. code
- better parse error reporting when the problem is at the end of the file

** Internals: 
- isomorphisms don't apply under signed/unsigned, to prevent the creation
  of things like unsigned signed int.  Need a better solution for this.

* 0.1.3

** Features: 
- help in building the configuration macro file. The -parse_c action
  now returns the 10 most frequent parsing errors. This give useful
  hints to extend standard.h.

** Bugfix:
- positions no longer allowed on \(, \|, and \)
- improved propagation of negation for isos in the presence of parens
- convert Todos in flow graph construction to recoverable errors
- fixed bug in treatment of when != true and when != false, to allow more
  than one of them per ...
- improve parsing of typedef of function pointer. 
- improve typing.
- parsing and typing support for old style C function declaration.
- consider position variables as modifications when optimizing the
  translation into CTL of function definitions

** Internals: 

* 0.1.2

** Bugfix:
- better handling of ifdef on statements in control flow graph.
- transform files even if they do not end in .c (thanks to Vegard Nossum)

** Internals: 
- merge code of yacfe

* 0.1.1

** Langage: 
 - support for initializer at toplevel, cf -test substruct

* 0.1

** first public release of the source code:

** Features
 - embeded python scripting
 - position

* beta 

** first public release of the binary

* alpha

** Features
 - lots of features ... look at coccinelle research papers and tutorials.
